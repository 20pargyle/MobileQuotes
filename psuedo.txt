Start with mobile HTML
Then mobile CSS

Initial page (mobile):	data-searched = false
	- Big almost-screen-width rounded-corner search bar on main page (desktop)
	DONE - Error message "comes out" of the bottom of the search bar
		Triggered on empty text and ___
	- Submit button is 1/3 search bar size, if not smaller
	- Random quote

Search page (mobile):	data-searched = true
	the majority of the screen is now well-spaced flex items that contain each quote
		inside: the quote, author, and whatever else.
	the properties of the quotes (and author-names) are similar to the initial-quote's.
		font, spacing, proportional size, etc.
	@overboard: quote icons in corners of the flex-box

@overboard Clean transitions between the two... with a "back button" that moves from "searched" to the initial page.

Pins:
	If a quote is tapped or clicked, the quote is pinned, permenantly, to the top of the list.
	It will stay pinned even if another search is performed.
	@overboard:
		When pinned, the icon (now filled) always shows.
		on hover (if not pinned) a (not-filled) pin icon appears.


function togglePin() {
	if already pinned:
		remove from pinnedArray
		set li to not be pinned
		move the li to the searched-quote-list
	else:
		add to pinnedArray
		set li to pinned
		move the li to pinned-quote-list

	if pinnedArray is not empty:
		element pinned-quote-container display = "flex";
	else:
		element pinned-quote-container display = "none";
}
