Start with mobile HTML
Then mobile CSS

Initial page (mobile):	data-searched = false
	- Title (big quote marks? in the corners....?)
	- Big almost-screen-width rounded-corner search bar on main page (desktop)
	- Error message "comes out" of the bottom of the search bar
		Triggered on empty text and ___
	- Submit button is 1/3 search bar size, if not smaller
	- Random quote

Search page (mobile):	data-searched = true
	the majority of the screen is now well-spaced flex items that contain each quote
		inside: the quote, author, and whatever else.


Pins:
	If a quote is tapped or clicked, the quote is pinned, permenantly, to the top of the list.
	It will stay pinned even if another search is performed.
	On the end of each quote flex-item, have a space for a pin icon that shows up on hover.
	When pinned, the icon (now filled) always shows.
	implementation:
		Add class "pinned" to the flex-item when pinned.
		When a quote is pinned, place its object in an array (and add to the screen).
		When the quote is clicked while pinned, the object is removed from the array (and the screen).
